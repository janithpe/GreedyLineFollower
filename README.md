# Greedy Line Follower

**Greedy Line Follower** is a simple computer vision project that demonstrates a greedy algorithm to follow a dark-colored line (e.g., black) from a user-defined start point in an image.

The algorithm:
- Uses OpenCV to process the image.
- Traces the darkest path pixel-by-pixel using a greedy search.
- Outputs a new image with the traced path visualized.

This project is useful for showcasing pathfinding logic, OpenCV techniques, and algorithm design in Python. Itâ€™s generalized from a work project and now works with any image containing a dark line.

More features and interactivity will be added soon!


**Example use cases:**
- Pathfinding demos
- Visual debugging of skeletonized paths
- CV-based flow diagrams or scanned maps
